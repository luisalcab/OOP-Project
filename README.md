## How to run
To run this project, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can use any C++ compiler, but I recommend using [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/). After installing MinGW, you need to add it to your system path. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW2VLrQ3Bs) to add MinGW to your system path. After that, you can run the following commands to compile and run the project:
```
g++ -o nave nave.cpp
./nave.exe
```
